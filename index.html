				<h2>Set up many different types of stores!</h2>
				<p>The Play Store Fun checkout system can be used to create a variety of stores such as grocery stores, pet stores, coffee shops, libraries and more! From experience with our own children, much of the fun comes with creating and setting up all new shops!</p>

					<p class="editable">One of my favorite pastimes as a child was spending hours setting up stores and then pretending to have customers. I was thrilled when one Christmas I received a calculator with a tape roll so I could print receipts! It’s been so fun watching my kids be able to experience that same type of imaginative play and much more thanks to Play Store Fun!</p>
